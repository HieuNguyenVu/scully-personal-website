description: 'I was a front-end engineer, and after my effort, I have the opportunity to work as a full-stack engineer. Cause I did not focus on the backend at the start, I believe that I was missed some core concepts of Spring and Spring Boot. This series is the way I recheck my knowledge and complement the missing part.'
